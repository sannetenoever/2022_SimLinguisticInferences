SSVEP simulations
For the SSVEP simulations we used the same representations as the output of the BNP. Data was represented as an activation vector of 52 time-steps (representing 52 words and 13 sentences for 100 repetitions) with word dimension of size 4. Either one-hot encoding of the words was done in a fully random manner, or every fourth word was the same and the other three words were randomly allocated to other positions. Data was analyzed in the same way as the parser and was up-sampled to a 12 Hz rate (filling the one-hot encoding values with zeros). Then we again extracted the power in the same manner as for the BNP.
