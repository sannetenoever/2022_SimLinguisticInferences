### Simulations of models that create 1-2-4 Hz pattern.

## Neural Berkeley Parser

We presented the pre-trained Neural Berkeley Parser ([github parser](https://github.com/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser); [en_charlstm_dev.93.61.pt model](https://github.com/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser/releases/download/models/en_charlstm_dev.93.61.pt) with the stimuli from the Ding et al., (2016) study. Related code and data are in the Parser folder.

## SSVEP simulations

We show that by having any systematic response to a class of stimuli you can get a 1-2-4 Hz response. Related code is in the SSVEP folder.
